# HackingBuddyGPT

How can LLMs aid or even emulate hackers? Threat actors are already using LLMs, so we need to create testbeds and ground truth for whitehats to learn and prepare. Currently we are using linux privilege escalation attacks as test use-case, but we are branching out into web-security and Active Directory testing too.

How are we doing this? We are providng testbeds as well as tools. The initial tool `wintermute` targets linux priv-esc attacks. It uses SSH to connect to a (presumably) vulnerable virtual machine and then asks OpenAI GPT to suggest linux commands that could be used for finding security vulnerabilities or privilege escalation. The provided command is then executed within the virtual machine, the output fed back to the LLM and, finally, a new command is requested from it..

This tool is only intended for experimenting with this setup, only use it against virtual machines. Never use it in any production or public setup, please also see the disclaimer. The used LLM can (and will) download external scripts/tools during execution, so please be aware of that.

We release all tooling, testbeds and findings as open-source as this is the only way that comprehensive information will find their way to defenders. APTs have access to more sophisticated resources, so we are only leveling the playing field for blue teams. For information about the implementation, please see our [implementation notes](docs/implementation_notes.md). All source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/ipa-lab/hackingbuddyGPT).

## Current features:

- connects over SSH (linux targets) or SMB/PSExec (windows targets)
- supports OpenAI REST-API compatible models (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt4, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, etc.)
- supports locally running LLMs
- beautiful console output
- logs run data through sqlite either into a file or in-memory
- automatic root detection
- can limit rounds (how often the LLM will be asked for a new command)

## Academic Research/Expsoure

hackingBuddyGPT is described in [Getting pwn'd by AI: Penetration Testing with Large Language Models ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00121):

## Example run

This is a simple example run of `wintermute.py` using GPT-4 against a vulnerable VM. More example runs can be seen in [our collection of historic runs](docs/old_runs/old_runs.md).

![Example wintermute run](docs/example_run_gpt4.png)

Some things to note:

- initially the current configuration is output. Yay, so many colors!
- "Got command from LLM" shows the generated command while the panel afterwards has the given command as title and the command's output as content.
- the table contains all executed commands. ThinkTime denotes the time that was needed to generate the command (Tokens show the token count for the prompt and its response). StateUpdTime shows the time that was needed to generate a new state (the next column also gives the token count)
- "What does the LLM know about the system?" gives an LLM generated list of system facts. To generate it, it is given the latest executed command (and it's output) as well as the current list of system facts. This is the operation which time/token usage is shown in the overview table as StateUpdTime/StateUpdTokens. As the state update takes forever, this is disabled by default and has to be enabled through a command line switch.
- Then the next round starts. The next given command (`sudo tar`) will lead to a pwn'd system BTW.

## Setup and Usage

We try to keep our python dependencies as light as possible. This should allow for easier experimentation. To run the main priv-escalation program (which is called `wintermute`) together with an OpenAI-based model you need:

1. an OpenAI API account, you can find the needed keys [in your account page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
    - please note that executing this script will call OpenAI and thus charges will occur to your account. Please keep track of those.
2. a potential target that is accessible over SSH. You can either use a deliberately vulnerable machine such as [Lin.Security.1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/) or a security benchmark such as our [own priv-esc benchmark](https://github.com/ipa-lab/hacking-benchmark).

To get everything up and running, clone the repo, download requirements, setup API-keys and credentials and start `wintermute.py`:

~~~ bash
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/andreashappe/hackingBuddyGPT.git
$ cd hackingBuddyGPT

# setup virtual python environment
$ python -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate

# install python requirements
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# copy default .env.example
$ cp .env.example .env

# IMPORTANT: setup your OpenAI API key, the VM's IP and credentials within .env
$ vi .env

# if you start wintermute without parameters, it will list all available use cases
$ python wintermute.py
usage: wintermute.py [-h] {linux_privesc,windows privesc} ...
wintermute.py: error: the following arguments are required: {linux_privesc,windows privesc}

# start wintermute, i.e., attack the configured virtual machine
$ python wintermute.py linux_privesc --enable_explanation true --enable_update_state true
