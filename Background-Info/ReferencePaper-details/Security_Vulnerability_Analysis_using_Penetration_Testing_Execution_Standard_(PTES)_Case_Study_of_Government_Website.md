<br>

### Goal: Testing utilized Kali Linux and tools (ex: OWASP ZAP, Acunetix, Nmap, Paros, and others)

<br>

## Additional Notes
<br>

**Real Life Attacks**

	Trojan attacks
		- 56% of all attacks
		
	Information Gathering Attacks
		- 43%
		
	Web Application Attacks
		- 1%

<br>
		
**System** 
	
	Def: collection of interrelated and organized elements that collaborate to perform a specific function and achieve a common objective
	
	Elements: 
		- System boundaries
		- System components
		- External environment
		- System interfaces
		- System inputs
		- System outputs
		- System processing
		- System objectives
		
<br>

**Information** 
	
	Def: set of processed data that is relevant and meaningful to the receiver in reducing uncertainties when making decisions
	
	Information system composed of:
		- Hardware
		- Software
		- Communication networks
		- Data sources
		- People (gather, transform, and distribute information)
		
<br>
		
**Assets:**
- Hardware
- Software
- Telecommunications infrastructure
- Services
- Personnel
- Applications

<br>

**Threats to Info Systems**

	(1) Active: malicous activities
		
		Ex: data theft, unauthorized system usage, illegal destruction, and unauthorized modification
		
	(2) Passive: non-malicous events
	
		Ex: system failures, human errors, and natural disasters

## Terminology

**System:** collection of interrelated and organized elements that collaborate to perform a specific function and achieve a common objective

**Information:** set of processed data that is relevant and meaningful to the receiver in reducing uncertainties when making decisions

**Computer network:** collection of interconnected computers that exchange data/information and share resources.

**Cybersecurity:** range of measures, policies, tools, and techniques employed to safeguard sensitive organizational and personal data from unauthorized access, use, or theft.

**Vulnerability:** weaknesses that exist in the design, implementation, or operation, and management found in the network system that can threaten.

**Vulnerability Assessment:** an activity that assesses security controls internally and externally by identifying vulnerabilities in systems, computer networks, applications, or other parts that create opportunities for attacks on target assets.

**Penetration Testing:** type of security testing where an assessor emulates real-world attacks to discover ways to bypass security features of an application, system, or network.

**Pre-Engagement Interactions:** aims to explain various tools and techniques used to assist before conducting penetration testing.

**Intelligence Gathering stage:** information is gathered about the target for the penetration testing. 

**Threat Modeling:** approach for conducting penetration testing is identified and examined.

**Vulnerability Analysis:** process of identifying weaknesses in systems and applications that can potentially be exploited by attackers.

**Exploitation phase:** gain unauthorized access to the system by circumventing any security measures that have been implemented.

**Post-exploitation phase:** assess the extent of the system’s vulnerability after the initial breach and determine how to maintain control for subsequent attacks.

**Reporting:** documents determine the basic criteria for reporting the penetration testing report.
