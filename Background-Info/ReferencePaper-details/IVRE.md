#### [Moloch](https://linuxsecurity.expert/tools/moloch/)

Project health: 97

Moloch comes with a web interface that allows for easy browsing of pcap data (packet capture). It can also search in the data or export it. Besides pcap, the JSON format is supported, so data can be easily consumed in other tools (like Wireshark).

Many released available, source code available, supported by large company

Usage: network security monitoring, security monitoring


#### [Scapy](https://linuxsecurity.expert/tools/scapy/)

Project health: 70

Scapy can handle tasks like network scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery. Due to its manipulation possibilities, Scapy can send invalid frames. It allows you also to inject custom 802.11 frames, or combine other attacking techniques.

Usage: network analysis, security assessment

#### [Pyersinia](https://linuxsecurity.expert/tools/pyersinia/)

Project health: 64

Pyersinia is a tool like Yersinia and can perform network attacks such as spoofing ARP, DHCP DoS , STP DoS, and more. It is written in Python and uses Scapy.

Uses: Network analysis, Penetration testing, Security assessment

#### [Zenmap](https://linuxsecurity.expert/tools/zenmap/)

Project health: 63

Zenmap is a graphical user interface (GUI) for Nmap. It can be of great help to start a network scan by simply selecting the options you want. Besides Linux, it also runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS, BSD, and other flavors of Unix.
