## Main Topics: (State of the Art)

### Solutions
The idea is to develop an 
* Open-Source usercustomizable OSINT and Web Vulnerability scanner
* in Python environment scripts 
* very transparent on the algorithm for performing OSINT search or Web Vulnerability scanning. 
* This feature is a nightmare for any pen-tester to test or track on their target endpoints using open-source that is highly transparent in scanning ports and functions that they trust on.
*  The tools for open-source intelligence related activities, and web vulnerability scanning as a user-customizable platform gives a pen-tester enormous activities perform and to trust its process without any harm of their targets.

**pen-tester to work ethically**

customizing the type and parameter he wants to scan instead of going unethical in an online 3rd party service provider
	
Action of adding unethical scripts into the python environment will be a bad result for the pen-tester itself, because of the highly transparent Open-source plugins we have added along with the package installation setup.

**Reduce Footprint**

There was a high need of having an open-source customizable OSINT and web vulnerabilities scanner so that the pen-testers can work on their stages oftesting without worrying about the footprints and the type of parameters that may run in the backend for 3rd party service providers.

### Tools

#### Traditional:
* Burp Suite
* Nmap
* Shodan
* Maltego
* Censys

### OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)/Cybercheck

* identify and target relevant data sources based on the specific requirements of the user

**Targets:** websites, social media platforms, public databases, government records, online forums, blogs, and more

#### Practices:

* Getting the online presence of the target
* Social media activity and log monitoring
* Contacts mentioned anywhere
* Links and connection of networks
* Recently accomplished work
* Involved in any social activities via medias or publications
* because of the inbuilt scanning and browser-dependent packages python provides as open-source for pen-testing.

#### Features: 
* WV Scan (Clickjacking)
* OSINT (IP Locator feature)
* OSINT (PDF Metadata Analysis)
* OSINT (URL Redirection Check)

#### Working:
* The python libraries import their dependencies and validate the user inputs with the browser web scrapping tools and platforms for OSINT.
* Infosint.py file holds all root dependencies and the main function calls to perform activities based on users' wishes.
* imagerecon.py is the file to practice an open OSINT of social accounts based on the image loaded by the user.
* Ip locator and traceip.py are filed to fetch some data about the IP input and relative registers held bythe IP.
* pdfanalysis.py is the most important OSINT parameter file that gets metadata and relative information of the input keyword and open documentation available
* webvuln.py is the main header file for web vulnerability scanning that performs a clean overalldraft of a handful of scans
	

	
### Methods (ex: Raspberry Pi)
**Python**
* powerful tool and a scripting language to build and inherit the features and modules of ethical hacking or in general cybersecurity
* most widely used automation scripting

### Misc

#### (Topic) Web Vulnerability
* Stage 2 of penetration testing phase
* Scanning practices: clickjacking, host header injection, subdomain enumeration and reverse IP

#### (Tools) Shodan
**Uses:**
	IoT device search engine, vulnerability scanner, and port scanning
	
**Interface:** GUI and API

**Open-Source:** no

**Limitations:**
* Code and implementation details are not available
* Not open source
* Search engine can be misused by attacker
* Complex to understand
	
#### (Tools) Censys
**Uses:** IoT search engine with vulnerability detection and filtering 
	
**Interface:** Web

**Open-Source:** Partial

**Limitations:**
* Require account creation after some interaction with search engine
* does not support IPv6

#### (Tools) Nmap
**Uses:**
* OS fingerprinting
* Port scanning
* host detection
* fundamental vulnerabilities

**Interface:** Command line

**Open-source:** Yes

**Limitations:** 

	Hard to master, only basic vulnerability provides

#### (Tools) Maltego
**Uses:**
	OSINT tool for reconnaissance
	
**Interface:** Web

**Open-Source:** No

**Limitations:** Complex
