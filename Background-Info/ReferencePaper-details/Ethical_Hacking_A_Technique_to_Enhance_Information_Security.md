### Goal: Hacking phases, general tools, types of attacks


<br>

### Additional Notes

**Ethical hacking** is also known as penetration testing, which uses its powers to hack data and information, steal passwords, credit card info, scan their e-mail id and other personal information for a good purpose in the world

## Approach

**Ethical Hacking Phases:**

(1) **Information Gathering**
- Use Network mapping **tools** for internal hack	
	- helps find network topology
- Collect info on:
	- host
	- people involved
	- networking
		
(2) **Scanning**
- Tools:
	- Port Scanning: locate host and used topologies of target organization
	- Network Scanning: identify active hosts
	- Vulnerability Scanning: installed on target network to determine safety threats
- Data:
	- kind of ports
	- kind of services
	- type of software
	- security guards
	- target IP addresses
	- user accounts
	
(3) **Gaining Access**

(4) **Maintaining Access**

(5) **Clearing Tracks**
- Clear all cookies and cache
- uninstall all applications used
- deleted folders created

## Tools
- **Nmap:** open-source tool for network discovery
- **Metasploit:** exploit tool for basic pen testing
- **Burp Suite:** mainly to track request and response between server and clients
- **Linux**: open-source OS, directly manages a system's hardware and resources

<br>

## Methods

**Attack Forms:**
- **Physical:** use bombs or instruments to destroy data
- **Syntactic:** use viruses, malware, trojan horse
- **Semantic:** first hacker approaches target, then causes error to system

<br>

**Attacks:**
- **Waterhole attacks:** attacker targets someone at the place
	- Ex: 
	
		(1) Attacker creates a fake Wi-Fi access point in a coffee shop and modifies all interested websites
		
		(2) When you join with that fake access, the attacker will be able to modify your personal information.
- **Clickjacking:** click on a link or button but there is a virtual

	- Ex: 
	
		(1) user uses a website and then clicks on a button to close the window
		
		(2) Attacker placed a button that will raise issues, delete the firewall rules, and trigger the download of a trojan horse
- **Cookie Theft (Session Hijacking):** attacker steals a cookie and uses that cookie for a session
