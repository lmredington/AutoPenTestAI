### Goal: Raspberry Pi-based OMV server is analyzed using nmap and nessus to derive both vulnerability security analysis results and recommendations

**Goal 1:** How can vulnerability security analysis and monitoring results be obtained for the OMV Cloud server running on Raspberry Pi? 

**Goal 2:** What are the vulnerability security recommendations for the OMV Cloud server running on Raspberry Pi?


<br>

### Additional Notes

**Denial of Service (DoS) attacks** pose significant threat to LAN and internet networks

## Approach

**PPDIOO model**
- **Prepare**: preparations are performed by using a Raspberry Pi to detect the issues with the Open Media Vault cloud server.
- **Plan**: software and hardware specifications for the research are described
- **Design**: discuss network topology to understand and simplify the concept of a security system 
- **Implement**: software installation is being done
- **Operate**: scanning is conducted 
- **Optimize**: network is handled by finding and fixing problems before they have an impact on the network
	
<br>

<a id="tools"></a>
## Tools
- **Nmap**: detect active hosts on a network and identify open ports
	- show ports
- **Nessus**: assess network vulnerabilities and generate security recommendations for the OMV Cloud server
	- show vulnerability category
	- descriptions of each information are shown on the colored icons
		- red icon: high vulnerability
		- orange icon: medium vulnerability
		- blue icon: low vulnerability
	- information is also received in the form of data descriptions that are then processed in a table.

## Equipment

Raspberry Pi

 OMV Cloud server
 
 Raspberry Pi -- employed as a network-attached storage (NAS) server
 - utilizing the Cloud Open Media Vault (OMV) software -- manage file and data storage. 
 - Access to the NAS server is provided via a Local Area Network (LAN)
