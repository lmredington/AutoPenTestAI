----

### Goal: focus on various vulnerability analysis tools forming basis for VAPT for short and try to analyze the various impact with respect to stages of penetration testing. (techniques)

**Goal 1:** Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing techniques

**Goal 2:** Highlight some of the general issues which can be encountered by using some of the open-source tools only

<br>

### Additional Notes
**Zones:**
- [External](#external-zone): connected to external network
- Demilitarized zone: web servers
- [Internal](#internal-zone)  

**Challenge:** False positives - requires manual verification

<br>

<br>
  
<a id="approach"></a>
## Approach

### Vulnerability Analysis Phases:
- [Discover](#discover): determine scope and testing activities
- [Access](#access): gain knowledge by using tools
- [Reporting](#reporting): Compliance & Remediation
- [Remediation](#remediation): strategies (accept, mitigate, transfer)
- [Verify](#verify): check remediation is successful

<br>

### Penetration Testing Phases:
- **Agreement**
- [Planning & Reconnaissance](#planning-reconnaissance): locating targets and methods for attack
- [Scanning](#scanning): perform attack and record responses
- [Gaining Access](#gain-access): includes persistance
- **Retaining Access:** maintain access for long and explore other resources
- [Exploitation](#exploitation): locating targets and methods for attack
- **Evidence and Reporting:** highlight number of vuln. and mitigation measures

<br>

<a id="solutions"></a>
## Solutions

Intruders are now using **automated structures** in form of BOTS, AI, ML, to perform these attacks.   

<br>

<a id="tools"></a>
## Tools

- **ZapBurp** (vuln. scan and mitigation measures)  
- **netcraft** (hosting/network details and background)
- **Whois** (websites, IP owner info)
- [Zenmap](#zenmap)
- [Maltego](#maltego)
- [Open VAS](#open-vas): vulnerability scanner
- **Metasploit**
- **Burp suite**
- **Wireshark**
- **Hydra**
- **Nessus**
- **Nexpose**

<br>

<a id="equipment"></a>
## Equipment (ex: Raspberry Pi)  

Vulnerable VM

<br> 

<a id="terminology"></a>
## Terminology

**Vulnerability:** security flaws in a system's architecture

**Vulnerability Assessment:** "seeks information about vulnerabilities in known packages and software"

**Penetration Testing:** "tries to exploit weakness in structure or environment"

<br>

----

## Misc

<a id="discover"></a>
**Discover (Vuln. Analysis Phase)**

	- goal and objectives
	- assets, information flow
	- determine scope and form basic penetration testing activities

<br>

<a id="access"></a>
**Access (Vuln. Analysis Phase)**

	- Testing using Tools, knowledge about infrastructure
	- tools can be host, network, database, and application based (e.g. ZAP and Burp)
	- Perform automated scan of target 
		- Black Box (no access to target)
		- White Box (authorized access to whole infrastructure and code
		- Grey Box (limitied access to resources)

<br>

<a id="reporting"></a>
**Reporting (Vuln. Analysis Phase)**

	Compliance (e.g. OWASP and ISO) & Remediation
	
<br>

<a id="remediation"></a>
**Remediation (Vuln. Analysis Phase)**

Strategies: 
- Accept (if cost parameters or high exploitability)
- [Mitigate](#mitigate): attempt to remove vuln. within system
- Transfer (transfer to 3rd party or other internal party)

<br>

<a id="verify"></a>
**Verify (Vuln. Analysis Phase)**

	Above step was sucessful
	
	Important feedback  

<br>

<a id="mitigate"></a>
**Mitigate (Remediation Strategy)**

	Def: attempt to remove vuln. within system

	- Fix vulnerablity with patch level update or upgrading version  

<br>

<a id="planning-reconnaissance"></a>
**Planning and Reconnaissance (Pen Testing Phase 2)**

Collect information:
- Physical location of target
- Data OS, hardware configuration
- Services, Phone list
- Sniffing
- Extraction through social engineering (include Impersonation, intrusion reverse social Engineering), Dumpster Diving internet foot printing, search Engines)

Tools:
- netcraft (hosting/network details and background)
- Whois (websites, IP owner info)
- [Zenmap](#zenmap)
- [Maltego](#maltego)

<br>

<a id="scanning"></a>
**Scanning (Pen Testing Phase 3)**

Def: Active recon. (network scan)
	 
Includes vulnerability scanners and port scanners
	 
Network scan important and crucial role in identifying packets format eg. TCP or IP, communication. 

Tools:
- [Open VAS](#open-vas): Vulnerability Scanner
		
<br>

<a id="gain-access"></a>
**Gaining Access (Pen Testing Phase 4)**

	Mechanisms: WEP cracking & ARP request replay
	
	Tool: Metasploit
	
<br>

<a id="exploitation"></a>
**Exploitation (Pen Testing Phase 6)**

	Tools:
	- Metasploit
	- Burp suite
	- Wireshark
	- Hydra
	
<br>

<a id="zenmap"></a>
**Zenmap (Recon & Planning Tool)**

	More refined than Nmap

	Uses UI features for Nmap

	Useful for gaining info in terms of Network Exploitation and open ports (e.g. Host details)

	Defined in this paper for Reconnaissance and planning

	Uses:
	- Operating system and version
	- list of open ports
	- services
	- Monitoring
	- Network inventory kind of tasks

<br>

<a id="maltego"></a>
**Maltego (Recon & Planning Tool)**

	Main: used to exploit using email (identified for Reconnaissance and planning)

	- open source and commercial
	- uses OSINT and graphical link analysis (for connection related information)
	- available on Windows, Linux, etc
	- efficient against connected information (e.g. email and phone numbers)

<br>

<a id="open-vas"></a>
**Open VAS (Scanning Tool)**

	Main: full feature vulnerability scanners
	
	- tests inside web application or web servers
	- supports authenticated crawl and auditing activities (ex: burp suite)
	- produces report, denoting severity
		
<br>

<a id="external-zone"></a>
**External Zones**

		connected to external network

		Exploitable Vulnerabilities:
		- firewall misconfiguration
		- usage of outdated components  
  
<br>

<a id="internal-zone"></a>
**Internal Zones**

		Exploits:
		- Social engineering
		- Computer worms
		- Insider attack
