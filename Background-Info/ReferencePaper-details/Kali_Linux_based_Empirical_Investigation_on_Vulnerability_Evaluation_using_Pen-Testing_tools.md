## Main Topics: (State of the Art)

### New approaches

Should be adjusted to the individual demands of the testing engagement, considering the target system or network, the customer's needs, and the testing team's resource. 

**Phases:**
(1) Pre-engagement Interactions (prep-stage)
(2) Information Gathering
(3) [Vulnerabilities analysis](#vuln-analysis) (scanning stage)
(4) Vulnerability exploitation (how deep within system to still discover targets)
(5) Post exploitation (intrusion complete, stay in machine without detection)
(6) Report Generation (methodology report)


**Attacks**
* [Password Attacks](#password-attack): guess/crack password for account
* [Malware Attacks](#malware-attack): malicious software
* SQL Injection: access sensitive info in database through malicious code on webside or app SQL database
* [XSS](#xss): Cross-site scripting
* MITM Attacks: intercept, alter, or insert malicious material into network communication
* [Firewall Attack](#firewall)


### Solutions
* Brute-force, phishing, and dictionary attacks --> password Attacks
* Virus, worms, ransomeware, and Trojan horses --> Malware Attack
* Counter measures for attacks: firewalls, access restrictions, IDS, IPS

Apply variety of testing approaches (ex: manual testing-code review- and stay up to date on threats and attack strategies)

**Testing Site**
1. Login to account in Google Chrome browser.
2. Export the cookies session from Cookie Editor in
Chrome Browser.
3. Again, open the login page in another browser (we
used Firefox).
4. Import cookies in the Firefox browser.
5. Paste the cookies in cookie editor and refresh the page.
6. Logged in.

### Issues
* Frequent false positives produced --> wasted time
* vulnerability scanning tool not able to scan 0-day vulnerability

### Tools (for reconnaissance and planning)
* [Wapiti](#wapiti): Web-app script flaws
* Skipfish: current web application security reconnaissance tool
* [Arachni](#arachni)
* [Nessus](#nessus): network security scanner
* w3af: finding and using web application vulnerabilities
* Acunetix: weak passwords, XSS, along with SQL injection
* Web Security: list in Table 1
* Nmap: port scanner
		
### Methods (ex: Raspberry Pi)
* OSs:
	* [Kali Linux](#kali-linux)
	* BlackArch
	* BackBox
	* Parrot Security OS
	* Pentoo i
	* WHAX is a Slackware-based operating system
* [RL](#rl) for automated pen testing ( more effort needed to be scalable and realistic) 
* Software:
	* VMware (sandbox environment)
	* [Kali Linux](#kali-linux) (inside Vmware, OS)
	* [ZAP Proxy](#zap-proxy)
	* Cookie Editor
	* Google Chrome Browser
	* Firefox Browser

### Misc

<a id="kali-linux"></a>
**(OS) Kali Linux**
	
	Utilities and tools preinstalled
	
	Good for: vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, digital forensics, and network analysis
	
	Tools are divided into several areas: Information Collecting, Password Attacks, Web Applications, Wireless Attacks, and Exploitation Tools. 
	
	Used by cybersecurity experts and researchers and ethical hackers
	
<br>

<a id="wapiti"></a>
**(Tool) Wapiti**

	Web-app security
	
	Performs black box based scans

	Becomes a fuzzer after acquiring source code issues, adding payloads to look for script flaws. 

<br>

<a id="arachni"></a>
**(Tool) Arachni**

	Pros: 
		
		Can handle attack/input vectors that non-humans would not normally be able to detect
		
		Exceptional performance (courtesy of Typhoeus)
		
		Asynchronous HTTP technique (contributes to great performance)

	Cons:
	
		Limitations due to audited server's responsiveness and your bandwidth (note: only limitations)

<br>

<a id="nessus"></a>
**(Tool) Nessus**

	Def: network security scanner tool
	
	Pros:
	
		Simple - Plug-in install
		
		Great all-purpose tool:

		Scan Windows and Unix systems
			
		Scan a variety of areas in a single session
		
<br>

<a id="vuln-analysis"></a>
**(Phase) Vulnerabilities Analysis**

	Network or machines is inspected for vulnerabilities
	
	Tester evaluates the vulnerabilities

	Judge factors:
		- OS
		- particular service version
		- firewall service
		- port #

<br>

<a id="password-attack"></a>
**(Attack) Password Attack**

	Attempts to guess/crack passwords used to safeguard user accounts

	Use: brute-force, phishing, and dictionary attacks

<br>

<a id="malware-attack"></a>
**(Attack) Malware Attack**

	Def: malicious software used to get unauthorised access to machine or network

	Use: virus, worms, ransomeware, and Trojan horses

<br>

<a id="xss"></a>
**(Attack) XSS**

	Cross-site scripting
	
	Uses: Insert malicious code to web pages of website or app

	Allows hacker to execute arbitrary code in view of victim's internet browser (ex: https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCWS53234.2021.970294)
	
<br>

<a id="firewall"></a>
**(Attack) Firewall**

	Able to record target Wi-Fi network handshakes to exploit and set up rogue AP and crack password

	Constructed phoney login page provided password

	Master key captured matched password

	Ex: "Penetration testing using Kali linux: SQL injection, XSS, wordpres, and WPA2 attacks" (https://doi.org/10.11591/ijeecs.v12.i2.pp729-737) (2018)
	
<br>

<a id="rl"></a>
**(New Tech) RL**

	Can be used to automate penetration testing 

	Con: currently not scalable 

	Example in "Static Machine Learning Based Evaluation Method for Usability and Security Analysis in E-Commerce website" (doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3247003)

<br> 

<a id="zap-proxy"></a>
**(Software) ZAP Proxy** 

	produced a lot of false positives

<br>
