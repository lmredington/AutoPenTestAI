The idea is to create an automated tool for penetration testing/vulnerability assessments. 

# Restrictions
Initally, intended, usage was for it to be used in a CCDC. However, due to tool limitation - per CCDC rules and restrictions - I am unable to utilize OpenAI (ChatGPT) for AI processing. The question now is prioritization. One idea is to first focus on development with OpenAI due to simplicity (rather than developing my own ML program). Once complete, then develop an ML program that serves as a relative replacement of OpenAI.

# Development Strategy

## Prep / Planning Steps

(1) Identify popular pen-testing tools (preferably within CCDC guidelines)
(2) Identify important data that needs to be captured
(3) Select tools that collect step 2's data
(3) Make rough layout of the (ideal) output - aka the final report the AI produces

## Development Steps
(3) For each tool selected in step 3 of the Planning Stage, develop code that will automate the tool and filter/format the output - pulling out the useful information that may be fed to the AI
(4) Compile each tools automated scan code into a main (.py) file so all of them can be run and scanned by running one file. 
(5) (opt. If focusing on CCDC) Implement an AI that will fetch the important info
(6) Use AI to analyze/filter/process the gathered data
(7) Based on the AI anaysis produce a file file/document that is readable and requires little background knowledge of pen-testing

# Functionality Outline

**Use SAT framework as template. **

## Process Initiator (PI): responsible for host discovery and initialization of the scanning process of the target URL

Host discovery tools: Nmap, Netcraft, Zenmap

**(1) Produce List of Hosts/targets**

Done with PI
	
	(1) scan and get list of hosts using nmap
		
	(2) make database/spreadsheet listing each host
	(3) use nslookup to see if there is a domain - note in spreadsheet
		
## Assessment Unit

**(2) Scan for vuln**



Use Vulnerability database:

 - [NVD API](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities) (CVSS, CVE, CPE)
 
 - [EPSS](https://www.first.org/epss/) (Likelihood of a particular vulnerability is to be exploited in the wild)
	
	ex: curl -X GET https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve="+ key_attr

## AI usage
**(3) Analyze Vuln**	

**(4) Produce Report**

# Pre-Condition Install Instructions: -- NEEDS TO BE UPDATED

## Download OpenAI (Linux) https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python

(1)

	python3 -m venv openai-env
	
(2)

	source openai-env/bin/activate

(3) 

	pip install --upgrade openai
	
(4) Create secret key and save it

(5) Verify API is working

	curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \  -H "Authorization: Bearer $your-secret-key" \  -H "OpenAI-Organization: org-CWpFAZh2MUaue9Q6q05opzmj"
	
	
## Download HackingBuddyGPT

### Clone the repository

	git clone https://github.com/andreashappe/hackingBuddyGPT.git && cd hackingBuddyGPT

## setup virtual python environment

	python3 -m venv venv
	
	source ./venv/bin/activate

## install python requirements

	pip install -r requirements.txt

## copy default .env.example

	cp .env.example .env

## IMPORTANT: setup your OpenAI API key, the VM's IP and credentials within .env

	vi .env

## if you start wintermute without parameters, it will list all available use cases

	python3 wintermute.py
	
usage: wintermute.py [-h] {linux_privesc,windows privesc} ...
wintermute.py: error: the following arguments are required: {linux_privesc,windows privesc}

## start wintermute, i.e., attack the configured virtual machine

	python wintermute.py linux_privesc --enable_explanation true --enable_update_state true

### If you run into issues with this last command, you may need to update the ssh port (22 or 2222)
